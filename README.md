Week 3 Javascript Challenge
The challenge this week was to add to the given code and create a working password generator using JavaScript.

<!-- TODO -->
if you accept, decline, and then accept again the gen variable doesnt update correctly, also, if you decline the confirmChoice prompt and choose settings again, sometimes the application doesnt write a password at all.
